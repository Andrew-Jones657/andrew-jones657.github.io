<h1> Finding an Ideal Site for a new Fire Station in Warren County, Kentucky </h1> <br>

<p> One of the most common and useful applications of GIS analysis is land suitability analysis, a process through which an ideal site is chosen from many candidate sites. This analysis process often involves considering geographic factors, whether social, economic, environmental, or physical, to determine how suitable an area is for a specific land use and human activity. Consequently, it tends to be complex and iterative, as numerous techniques such as overlays, queries, buffers, intersections, raster operations, and others are common in this analysis.  </p> <br>

<p> In this project, the objective is to find an ideal site for a new professional fire station or upgrade an existing volunteer fire station in Warren County, Kentucky. Since land use data is essential to this study, land parcels will serve as the base layer. Various other spatial data relevant to locating an ideal site will be collected, processed, and weighed as either a constraint or an opportunity. Then, these data will be intersected with the land parcel data to produce a set of ideal sites. Population density, long term population trends, and potential future land use changes will be used to identify existing fire stations suitable for an upgrade to a professional fire station. As fire stations are the object of this analysis, it is also important to locate a fire station that will best improve the fire response service to the underlying population. This will be achieved using service area analysis, areal proportion analysis, and location allocation analysis methods.  </p> <br>

<p> Data for this project stems from many sources. These include economic (median property value), demographic (census data), governmental (land use, future land use, transportation, zoning), and physical (elevation, karst, water) data. Detailed information about these data, such as the type of data and their purpose, is contained in Table 1 below. A visualization of each data layer is also depicted in Figure 1. </p> <br>
