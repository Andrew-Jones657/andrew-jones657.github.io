<h1> Progress </h1>

<p1> Things have been moving along well lately! I have my first project, the Site Selection Analysis, out now. It serves as a good example of classic GIS analysis, some demographic analysis, and some network analyses from ArcGIS Pro's Network Analyst Extension. 
I also have my geospatial work experience articles out as well, though I will be editing the Missouri House of Representatives article -- I am still thinking about what would serve as a fruitful addition to the article. </p1> <br>

<p> Beyond those projects, I have a repository for my GIS scripts up as well, though I will be going back into that to clean it up some more and stress test some of the python scripts. I am planning to put two more projects up as well: one will involve interpolation methods and multivariate 
statistics such as k-means and principle component analysis, and the other will be more of a tutorial on GIS data acquisition, dissemination, management, and processing. </p> <br>
