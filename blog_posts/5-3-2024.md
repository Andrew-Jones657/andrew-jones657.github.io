<h1> Continuing On </h1>

<p1> I wanted to take the time to post a minor update since I have been quiet. The good news is, I have some projects that I will soon be hosting on here! 
These will pertain to my work experience over the past few years. Unfortunately, however, my mother broke her shoulder recently, so I have been trying my best to assist her in her recovery. </p1> <br>
