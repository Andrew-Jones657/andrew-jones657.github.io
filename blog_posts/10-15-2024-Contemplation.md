<h1> Contemplation </h1>

<p> It's been an interesting period of time since my last blog update. I went out with my brother to Montana (Bozeman - Yellowstone area) in early September for a mini vacation. It was quite pleasant to see a different part of the country and spend some quality time with family. I have also been helping 
  some friends move in the Louisville area: it's always interesting to get to explore places that are closeby yet unfamiliar. </p> <br>

<p> As to professional work, things have been going somewhat slowly in my consulting career. I am very much looking at seasonal work, or at least something to pay the bills for a bit. I will still be updating my website in the meantime, though the updates might be rolling in a little bit slower. </p> <br>

<p> Concerning what I have added to the site itself, I have two more big projects in the works. One concerns GIS interpolation techniques as well as multivariate statistical methods, and the other looks at land use change via remote sensing techniques. The former is nearly done: I just need to clean up the 
some of the workflow. The latter might take a while still since the image analyst tools on ArcGIS take a long time to process datasets. Beyond the projects, I have a couple of GIS tutorials that are published. These tutorials are used to explain some of the workflow steps from my projects in depth. </p> <br>

<p> Otherwise, I have been considering creating a map gallery page where I upload single subject maps. This would include both interactive and static maps regarding a wide variety of subjects.    </p> <br>
