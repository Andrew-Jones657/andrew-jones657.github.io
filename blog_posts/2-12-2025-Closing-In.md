<h1> Closing In </h1>

<p> It has been a moment since I have added a substantial update to this site. I celebrated a fairly good Christmas and New Years with family and friends: I was out in Gatlinburg, TN for New
Years with a couple of friends and we had a good time seeing the mountains, town, and firework show on New Years. As a Christmas gift to ourselves, my family decided to go out to the San Francisco Bay Area in January, which was a lot of fun. It had been quite a while since we took a family vacation. </p> <br>

<p> I have been hard at work trying to hammer out some more entries onto this site. The most important updates are the completion of the multivariate methods and remote sensing projects. 
These are fairly standard workflows in GIS, though I find the final products of these analyses are quite interesting and useful. I need to iron out a few small sections on both of these projects, but they are both 95% done essentially. </p> <br>

<p> Additionally, I updated the travel map with some more locations and photos. I have been meaning to do this for a while, it just takes some time to locate all the photos I want and 
add them to the application. Hopefully that fills out the map a little bit more!  </p> <br>

<p> Finally, I created some cartographic products for the map gallery section. These have been quite enjoyable to work on since they do not take long to create. I have been attempting to alternate between static and interactive web maps, though I would like to do one that is completely cartography focused still -- I will have to find a suitable subject to map! </p> <br>

<p> Beyond that, I think I am really coming to the point where I want to look for work full-time again. I will still be modifying things here, but generally things here are looking pretty solid.  </p> <br>
