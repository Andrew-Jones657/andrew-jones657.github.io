    title: Missouri Congressional Redistricting 2022

<body>


<p3> Congressional redistricting occurs every ten years after both the US Census and apportionment are completed. Apportionment is the process by which each state’s population and population change is used to calculate its number of congressional seats. In Missouri, the congressional map is drawn by the state legislators and passed like a normal bill. Depending on the state, Congressional maps are passed by state legislatures, nonpartisan/bipartisan citizens commissions, or select commissions.  </p3> <br>

<p4> Congressional maps are drawn using boundary and population information from the US Census bureau. Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) line files such as counties, cities, voting precincts, and census blocks serve as boundary files, and the population and demographic information is included in PL 94-171. </p4> <br>

<p5> After the data is prepared, the process of map drawing may begin. Counties, cities, voting precincts, and census blocks are assigned district numbers to create new congressional districts. Typically, software such as Maptitude for Redistricting or ESRI Redistricting are used to create and manage redistricting plans. In the past two redistricting cycles, online redistricting programs have opened the process to the public, who can now more easily provide input on the process to map makers.   </p5> <br>

<p6> Many requirements and criteria apply when drawing a congressional district – attempting to work in even a few of the following factors becomes complex. This is not intended to be a deeply extensive list, but simply a glimpse at what all may be considered in drawing congressional districts.  </p6> <br>

          <li> Congressional districts must be drawn down to the person, with population deviations as minimal as practicable. </li> 
          <li> Some states may have constitutional rules that allow for some flexibility on this (such as preventing splitting counties), but, in general, congressional districts are permitted far smaller   population deviations than other types of political districts. </li>

          <ul>
          <li> Congressional districts must also be contiguous, meaning that districts are one geographic unit without separate portions surrounded by another district.  </li>
          <li> At the highest geographic scale, this means that all the census blocks within a district are connected by at least one edge (not vertex).  </li>

         <ol>
         <li> There is a sufficiently large and geographically compact racial minority or language group to form a majority in a single-member district. </li>
         <li> This minority group is politically cohesive (members vote similarly) </li>
         <li> The majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it … usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate. </li>

      <td> Requirement </td>
      <td> Compactness </td>
      <td> 
         <ul>
         <li> Congressional districts should be compact, meaning they are square shaped and do not have strange protrusions. </li>
         <li> This is a more difficult criteria to evaluate than population deviations or contiguity, as the line between a compact and non-compact district can be more ambiguous. </li>
         <li> Compactness is typically measured with mathematical tests such as Roeck, Schwartzberg, Polbsy-Popper, etc. </li>

        <li> Many factors can constitute a community of interest: this can be helpful in that it describes so many qualitative aspects of the underlying population that cannot be observed in census data alone.  </li>
        <li> However, district numbers are fixed and require a certain population, so it is not always possible to preserve every possible community of interest. </li>

        <li> Cultural and physical geography often play into creating congressional districts where inhabitants have a shared lifestyle/area that they live in.  </li>
        <li> Examples of this in Missouri could include formal and vernacular regions such as St Louis, Kansas City, the Ozarks, the Bootheel, Little Dixie, the Lead Belt, etc. </li>    
        <li> Such districts are often based on shared history between inhabitants, linking back to Communities of Interest. </li>

        <li> Generally, this is in the interest of good governance, as it is much easier for the public to understand unsplit congressional districts and for county officials to conduct elections. </li>

     <td> Competitive/Proportional Districts </td>

        <li> Competitive districts, as the name suggests, are congressional districts drawn as close to 50/50 partisan values as possible.  </li>

<p7> Considering all the criteria and requirements for redistricting (Table 1), one quickly finds that that it is impossible to create a map incorporating all the criteria. Some of these criteria, such as competitiveness and safe districts, outright contradict one another. Typically, whatever entity draws the congressional districts will focus on a few of these criteria during the mapmaking process.  </p7> <br>

<h2> History of the process </h2>

<p8> Touching on some history of congressional redistricting in Missouri towards the end of the 20th century, the process had been plagued by a good deal of stalemates. In both the 1970s and 1980s cycle, the legislature failed to agree on a congressional map. The Democrat dominated state legislature could not create consensus among its caucus members or broker an arrangement with republicans, and ultimately the congressional map was drawn by the courts. Democrats were able to pass a map for both the 1990s and 2000s cycle, and generally the map remained consistent in terms of the parts of the Missouri the congressional districts represented.  </p8>

<h3> Redistricting in the new Millenium </h3>

<p10> The 2002 redistricting cycle serves as an interesting place to start, as it occurred during a vast upheaval in Missouri’s political landscape: the flip of the state legislature from Democrat control to Republican control. This would have stark consequences down the line, but during the 2002 redistricting cycle, legislative power was split between the chambers. While the house was still Democrat led, the Republicans had gained the senate in the previous 2000 election.  </p10>
