    title: Missouri Congressional Redistricting 2022

<body>


<p3> Congressional redistricting occurs every ten years after both the US Census and apportionment are completed. Apportionment is the process by which each state’s population and population change is used to calculate its number of congressional seats. In Missouri, the congressional map is drawn by the state legislators and passed like a normal bill. Depending on the state, Congressional maps are passed by state legislatures, nonpartisan/bipartisan citizens commissions, or select commissions.  </p3> <br>

<p4> Congressional maps are drawn using boundary and population information from the US Census bureau. Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) line files such as counties, cities, voting precincts, and census blocks serve as boundary files, and the population and demographic information is included in PL 94-171. </p4> <br>

<p5> After the data is prepared, the process of map drawing may begin. Counties, cities, voting precincts, and census blocks are assigned district numbers to create new congressional districts. Typically, software such as Maptitude for Redistricting or ESRI Redistricting are used to create and manage redistricting plans. In the past two redistricting cycles, online redistricting programs have opened the process to the public, who can now more easily provide input on the process to map makers.   </p5> <br>

<p6> Many requirements and criteria apply when drawing a congressional district – attempting to work in even a few of the following factors becomes complex. This is not intended to be a deeply extensive list, but simply a glimpse at what all may be considered in drawing congressional districts.  </p6> <br>

      <td> 
          <ul> 
          <li> Congressional districts must be drawn down to the person, with population deviations as minimal as practicable. </li> 
          <li> Some states may have constitutional rules that allow for some flexibility on this (such as preventing splitting counties), but, in general, congressional districts are permitted far smaller   population deviations than other types of political districts. </li>

          <ul>
          <li> Congressional districts must also be contiguous, meaning that districts are one geographic unit without separate portions surrounded by another district.  </li>
          <li> At the highest geographic scale, this means that all the census blocks within a district are connected by at least one edge (not vertex).  </li>

         <ol>
         <li> There is a sufficiently large and geographically compact racial minority or language group to form a majority in a single-member district. </li>
         <li> This minority group is politically cohesive (members vote similarly) </li>
         <li> The majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it … usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate. </li>

      <td> Requirement </td>
      <td> Compactness </td>
      <td> 
         <ul>
         <li> Congressional districts should be compact, meaning they are square shaped and do not have strange protrusions. </li>
         <li> This is a more difficult criteria to evaluate than population deviations or contiguity, as the line between a compact and non-compact district can be more ambiguous. </li>
         <li> Compactness is typically measured with mathematical tests such as Roeck, Schwartzberg, Polbsy-Popper, etc. </li>

        <li> Many factors can constitute a community of interest: this can be helpful in that it describes so many qualitative aspects of the underlying population that cannot be observed in census data alone.  </li>
        <li> However, district numbers are fixed and require a certain population, so it is not always possible to preserve every possible community of interest. </li>

<p7> Considering all the criteria and requirements for redistricting (Table 1), one quickly finds that that it is impossible to create a map incorporating all the criteria. Some of these criteria, such as competitiveness and safe districts, outright contradict one another. Typically, whatever entity draws the congressional districts will focus on a few of these criteria during the mapmaking process.  </p7> <br>

<h2> History of the process </h2>

<p8> Touching on some history of congressional redistricting in Missouri towards the end of the 20th century, the process had been plagued by a good deal of stalemates. In both the 1970s and 1980s cycle, the legislature failed to agree on a congressional map. The Democrat dominated state legislature could not create consensus among its caucus members or broker an arrangement with republicans, and ultimately the congressional map was drawn by the courts. In particular, the 1980s cycle dealt with the loss of a congressional district which exacerbated tensions even further. However, in the 1990s and 2000s cycles, Democrats were able to successfully pass maps. </p8>

<h3> Redistricting in the new Millenium </h3>

<p10> Map goes here </p10>

<p11> The 2002 redistricting cycle serves as an interesting place to start, as it occurred during a vast upheaval in Missouri’s political landscape: the flip of the state legislature from Democrat control to Republican control. This would have stark consequences down the line, but during the 2002 redistricting cycle, legislative power was split between the chambers. While the house was still Democrat led, the Republicans had gained the senate in the previous 2000 election.  </p11>

<p12> Looking at the makeup of the districts at the time: </p12>

<ul>
<li> The first congressional district consisted of northern and central corridors of St Louis City as well as northern suburbs in St Louis County. It changed greatly in this cycle, as it was reworked to lose inner ring suburbs and gain more of northwestern St Louis County suburbs such as Breckenridge Hills, Bridgeton, Creve Coeur, Edmunson, Florissant, Frontenac, Hazelwood, Ladue, Maryland Heights, Olivette, Overland, St. Ann, and Woodson Terrace. Although it lost some black population in this change, the district remained the state’s single majority black and most democratic district.  </li>
<li> The second congressional district consisted of western St. Louis County, suburban portions of St. Charles County, and Lincoln County. It gained Lincoln County and more of St. Charles County in this cycle to make up for the parts of St. Louis County it lost. It did, however, gain some South St. Louis County municipalities such as Concord, Crestwood, Grantwood Village, Sappington and parts of Kirkwood and Sunset Hills.  </li>
<li> The third congressional district consisted of South St. Louis City, Central and Southern St. Louis County suburbs, Jefferson County, and Ste. Genevieve County. It gained many liberal inner-ring suburbs in this cycle such as Brentwood, Clayton, Maplewood, Richmond Heights, Rock Hill, and parts of Kirkwood, University City, and Webster Groves. It was a democrat leaning district consisting mainly of white middle- and working-class democrats.  </li>
<li> The fourth congressional district consisted of rural western Missouri, mid Missouri, and Kansas City suburbs and exurbs. It had moved further south in this cycle, gaining Barton, Cedar, Dade, and parts of Polk County, while losing its eastern counties, namely Maries, Miller, Osage, and parts of Camden County to the ninth. It also lost urbanized portions in Cass and Jackson Counties. Although it had a Republican lean, it was represented by a longtime conservative Democrat.   </li>
<li> The fifth congressional district consisted of Kansas City in Jackson County, as well as parts of Independence, Lee’s Summit, and southeastern Jackson County. Parts of suburban Cass County, such as Raymore and Belton, were added into the fifth in this cycle. Like the first and third districts, the fifth was a reliable democrat district.   </li>
<li> The sixth district consisted of rural northwestern Missouri and northern Kansas City and suburbs. Other than losing Ray County and gaining some portions of Jackson County, it remained the same.  </li>
<li> The seventh district consisted of southwestern Missouri, including the Springfield and Joplin areas, as well as portions of Polk and Taney Counties. It grew greatly since the 1990s, and lost Barton, Cedar, Dade, Douglas, and Ozark Counties. It also lost portions of Polk and Taney Counties.    </li>
<li> The eighth congressional district consisted of much of southern and southeastern Missouri, including Cape Girardeau, the Bootheel, Poplar Bluff, and much of the Ozarks. It gained Douglas, Ozark, and Taney Counties while losing Crawford County.  </li>
<li> The ninth congressional district consisted of rural northeastern Missouri, mid Missouri, and St Louis exurbs. It included Hannibal, Kirksville, Columbia, and parts of Lake of the Ozarks. Since it had lost Lincoln County and large parts of St. Charles County to the second, it expanded further south to include Crawford, Maries, Miller, Osage, and parts of Camden County. </li>
