<h1> <b> A little bit about me </b> </h1>

<h3> Where I am from </h3>

<p> I was born and raised in Bowling Green, Kentucky to an American father and a German mother. It's a great place to raise a family and just up the road from Nashville. </p> <br>

<p> I tend to have a lot of interests, but as a child, I was particularly fascinated by my dad's 1981 National Geographic World Atlas. After three semesters at Western Kentucky University, I realized I was truly passionate about geography. </p> <br>

<h3> My educational background </h3>

<p> In May of 2020, I graduated from Western Kentucky University with Bachelor's degrees in Human Geography and German Language and Culture, as well as minors in mathematics and GIS. At first glance, it's an unusual combination of subjects, but each of them tie together well. My minors provided a much stronger quantitative and scientific backbone to my geography degree, while my German degree allowed me to experience more of the liberal arts side of things.  </p> <br>

<h3> What I used to do  </h3>

<p> Most recently, I worked at <b> the Missouri House of Representatives </b> as the GIS redistricting analyst. In this position, I assisted representatives with drafting congressional district plans and I provided all sorts of data figures from the 2020 US Census. I also helped update the House's web map API from the old Google Maps API to the Leaflet API, and I created 163 custom maps for each of the newly redistricted state house districts.  <br> <br> I have also worked at <b> Warren County Public Works Division of Stormwater Management </b> as a GIS services intern. Here, I had the opportunity to do various GIS related tasks for the department, and I learned a lot about database management by helping create the stormwater asset collection form that I later used to collect over 1000 stormwater assets across Warren County, KY.    </p> <br>

<h3> What I am doing now </h3>

<p> Currently, I am searching for a new position! Since my temporary position at the Missouri House of Representatives ended in July of 2023, I have been spending my time helping my family out with temporary health issues, traveling, and working part time as a freelance analyst. </p> <br>

<h3> My hobbies </h3> 

<p> Outside of work, I enjoy camping, cycling, disc golf, hiking, photography, spending time with my friends and family, traveling, and walking. </p> <br> 

<p> Feel free to explore some photos from my travels. I recommend using the full screen functionality at the top-left part of the web map. The ribbon at the top-right contains bookmarks that will center the map extent directly on destinations.  </p> <br>
