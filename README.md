<h1> Andrew Jones </h1>

<p1> Welcome to my website. I am a geospatial professional. My professional experience is primarily in stormwater management and congressional redistricting. </p1>

<p2> My educational background is in Geography, German Language and Culture, Geographic Information Science, and Mathematics. More specfically, I graduated from Western Kentucky University in 2020 with Bachelor's degrees in Human Geography and German, as well as minors in mathematics and GIS. Much of my educational background focused on data analysis, though I have also taken the time to brush up on my skills in other areas such as programming, database management, and cloud platforms. </p2>

<p3> Outside of work, I enjoy walking, cycling, hiking, traveling, camping, photography, and spending time with my friends and family. </p3>
